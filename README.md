# Angular Event Registration â€” Demo Application for Angular JS

This project is a sample application demonstrating a more fully developed realistic single page
angular application.

### Server

A node server is provided. From the command line run "npm install" and then either "server.sh" if you are on a linux box or "server.bat" if you are on a windows box.

### Running the application

Navigate your browser to `http://localhost:1337/` to see the app running in your browser. You may have to add the page to the url such as EventDetails.html depending on where you are at in the course. The port may be configured in the node server.
